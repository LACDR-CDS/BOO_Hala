"0","#A value close to 1 means a strong positive linear correlation (e.g., as the factor's value increases, the PC score tends to increase)."
"0","#A value close to -1 means a strong negative linear correlation (e.g., as the factor's value increases, the PC score tends to decrease)."
"0","# A value close to 0 means a weak or no linear correlation between that factor and that PC."
"0",""
"0","#PC2: Shows a moderate negative correlation of -0.40. This suggests that PC2 captures a notable portion of the variance that is related to changes in drug concentration (as concentration increases, PC2 scores tend to decrease, or vice-versa)."
"0","#PC4: Shows a moderate positive correlation of 0.47. This also indicates PC4 is influenced by concentration."
"0","#PC13: Shows a moderate positive correlation of 0.42."
"0","#PC14: Shows a moderate negative correlation of -0.30."
"0","#Other PCs generally have weaker correlations with"
