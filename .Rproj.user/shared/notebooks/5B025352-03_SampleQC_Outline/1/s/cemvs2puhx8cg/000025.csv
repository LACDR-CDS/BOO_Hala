"0","# Controls (DMSO, Medium): Show consistent and high library sizes, indicating good quality."
"0","#Diisopropanolamine: Library sizes are fairly consistent across its different concentrations."
"0","#L-Tyrosine: Shows more variability in library sizes across its concentrations compared to other groups."
"0","#Overall: No obvious trend of library size changing systematically with drug concentration is visible. The data generally indicates robust sequencing depth across all samples."
