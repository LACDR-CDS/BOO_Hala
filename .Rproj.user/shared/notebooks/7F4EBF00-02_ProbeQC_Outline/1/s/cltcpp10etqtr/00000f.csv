"0","# In the countData. I started with 22,533 probes. In Exercise 8, I identified 603 probes with no gene_symbol. In Exercise 11, I subsetted countData to remove these probes. So, 22533 - 603 = 21930 probes remaining is correct."

"0","# MetaData object has not been altered in terms of its number of samples (rows) or variables (columns).The manifest started with 22,533 probes and 11 columns. In Exercise 10, We added the flag_realignment column, and in Exercise 12, We added the probe_name column. So, 11 + 2 = 13 columns is expected."
