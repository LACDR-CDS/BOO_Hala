"0","# This output indicates that all 60 samples in your dataset have a low_corr_flag of FALSE. This means that no samples were flagged as having a low replicate correlation based on your criterion (max_r2 < corr_threshold, where corr_threshold is 0.9)."

"0","#This aligns with the visual interpretation of the boxplot from Exercise 13, where all samples appeared to have max_r2 values at or above the 0.9 threshold. It's a good sign, suggesting strong reproducibility among your replicates."
