  # Setup
  
  ## Clean
  
  As before, we perform several setup steps at the start of the script to ensure our work is reproducible and clear. 

**Exercise 1: Download the R markdown template, clean your environment, and set the following variables:**
  
  * `root_dir` - project folder
* `cpm_path` - location of the `cpmData` object
* `metadata_path` - location of the `metaData` object


```{r script4}

rm(list = ls())

```
