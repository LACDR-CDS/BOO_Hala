> In this script, you will export your log2FC in a format suitable for upload to the PHH TXG-MAPr.

# Setup

## Clean

As before, we perform several setup steps at the start of the script to ensure our work is reproducible and clear. 

**Download the R markdown template, clean your environment, set variables, and load in `tidyverse`:**

* `root_dir` - project folder
* `low_store` - location of DEG results for the low toxicity compound
* `high_store` - location of DEG results for the high toxicity compound

```{r clean}
# Clean
rm(list=ls())

# Paths
low_store <- file.path("Output/low_store.csv")
high_store <- file.path("Output/high_store.csv")



txg_store <- "TXG_upload"

# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
```

***

## Load data

**Load the DEG results R environment:**

```{r load-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

res_low  <- read_csv("output/low_store.csv")

res_high  <- read_csv("output/high_store.csv")

```

***

# Upload

## File format

Upload files to the TXG-MAPr need the following variables:

* `experiment` defines the experiment (mean_ID). You will be able to look at map activation for each experiment separately.
* `gene_id` defines the gene ID (gene_symbol)
* `time` defines the time of exposure (24 hours for these samples)
* `conc` defines the concentration (dose level)
* `log2fc` specifies the log2 fold change
* `pvalue` defines the p-value
* `padj` defines the adjusted p-value

**Make the data frame and save it as a text file:**

Making text files to calculate EG scores

```{r}
txg_high <- res_high %>% 
  separate(mean_ID, sep="_", into=c("Compound", "conc", NA), remove=F) %>% 
  mutate(time = 24) %>% 
  select(
    experiment = mean_ID,
    gene_id = gene_symbol,
    time, conc, log2fc = log2FoldChange, pvalue, padj)

write_tsv(txg_high, path=paste0(root_dir, txg_store, "_high.txt"))

txg_low <- res_low %>% 
  separate(mean_ID, sep="_", into=c("Compound", "conc", NA), remove=F) %>% 
  mutate(time = 24) %>% 
  select(
    experiment = mean_ID,
    gene_id = gene_symbol,
    time, conc, log2fc = log2FoldChange, pvalue, padj)

write_tsv(txg_low, path=paste0(root_dir, txg_store, "_low.txt"))
```

These can then be imported into the PHH TXG-MAPr and explored.
